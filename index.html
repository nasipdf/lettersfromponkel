Maybe you didnt notice or remembered, but man iermm if u werent here id probably be worse. In the sense that i really enjoy and need ur company. Dulu kamu friend crush aku and i tried to win ur affection bcs well i wanted to be ur friend. Maaf ya kalo aku banyak salah dan keseringan jadi beban. Ive never felt so comfortable with an irl before i met u, ure weird funny but u can be serious at times. I remembered pas dulu aku gambar di cafe di klaten sm ur parents and tante nurul said smth abt my mom and u went defensive about it. Thanks for knowing my situation and thanks for keeping it in mind. And the other time where i tweeted out that i was alone in w17 u immediately rushed over and accompanied me. Honestly ure very sweet and im lucky to have met u.. Apa ya… i was really sad lowk in w17 i was going #thru it but with ur company, kamu sering main ke kamarku, sering tidur sama aku, aku sering ke kamar mu, just seeking ur company, and u were happy to oblige and give it made my days in rushd. I think ill cry a lot when we part pas lulus, but thats for future azel. Im proud of how far uve come so far, dari krenova, opsi, ispo, everything, uve fought hard and im always happy to see u shine. Mau di podium ato di kelas, im just happy seeing u live and thrive :3 semoga kita bisa cuddle terus dan berteman ya, i hope you’ll grant me a space next to your side in the years to come. Love u so much acha!! My bff <3"

Ive come to love and forgive myself because uve done that to me many times, i find myself giving the same love u gave me to my friends so.. Heh. ure basically spreading ur love to people in indonesia too. Lowk i was a very loner loser kid who basically had no friends, and it was getting very depressing. But all that changed when i met u, thanks for filling my days with ur company and allowing me to stay by your side. I hope we can grow old together. I know that sounds cringe and u prolly dont want to live that long but if i have to grow old u have to, ok ? sorry if i became nonchalant distant or dry text with my wording these days. I honestly just like the aura lowercases give off IJBOL and yeah. I hope we can continue to be friends. Thanks for putting up with my bs, i hope ure ready for rin bs for the next 50 years. Lets get a cat one day. Or live close. Cuz i think ill prolly die if i dont have a responsible friend around me. I hope ull continue to be happy and im always wishing and hoping and praying and manifesting for ur happiness. Wether that happiness comes from fanta, from seeing a cute cat reel, i hope u can allow urself to enjoy those feelings and moments. Dont restrict yourself to things, because ull only lose. Yk like. Its not a win-win situation for anyone. And i hope u can spend the rest of ur days living for urself. -love, rinnie"},
