Maybe you didnt notice or remembered, but man iermm if u werent here id probably be worse. In the sense that i really enjoy and need ur company. Dulu kamu friend crush aku and i tried to win ur affection bcs well i wanted to be ur friend. Maaf ya kalo aku banyak salah dan keseringan jadi beban. Ive never felt so comfortable with an irl before i met u, ure weird funny but u can be serious at times. I remembered pas dulu aku gambar di cafe di klaten sm ur parents and tante nurul said smth abt my mom and u went defensive about it. Thanks for knowing my situation and thanks for keeping it in mind. And the other time where i tweeted out that i was alone in w17 u immediately rushed over and accompanied me. Honestly ure very sweet and im lucky to have met u.. Apa ya… i was really sad lowk in w17 i was going #thru it but with ur company, kamu sering main ke kamarku, sering tidur sama aku, aku sering ke kamar mu, just seeking ur company, and u were happy to oblige and give it made my days in rushd. I think ill cry a lot when we part pas lulus, but thats for future azel. Im proud of how far uve come so far, dari krenova, opsi, ispo, everything, uve fought hard and im always happy to see u shine. Mau di podium ato di kelas, im just happy seeing u live and thrive :3 semoga kita bisa cuddle terus dan berteman ya, i hope you’ll grant me a space next to your side in the years to come. Love u so much acha!! My bff <3"

Honestly it was so cute and sweet it made my day. Ure doing great rara, better than what u think. I know u probably dont feel like it but uve already made ur parents proud, and i think ull continue to do so despite ur tumbles sometimes. I hope u dont let ur thoughts eat u too much, u can always come to me acha telkomsel or anyone u trust. Trust me its better sharing grief than shouldering it on ur own.

I know that sounds cringe and u prolly dont want to live that long but if i have to grow old u have to, ok ? sorry if i became nonchalant distant or dry text with my wording these days. I honestly just like the aura lowercases give off IJBOL and yeah. I hope we can continue to be friends. Thanks for putting up with my bs, i hope ure ready for rin bs for the next 50 years.
